# worldcup-sweepstakes
A project I came up with to test my programming knowledge.

My goal for this project is for it to take scores from different users and save their data to a CSV file. Then as the world cup tournament goes on, compare the predictions of those users automatically using Python. 


How to use
-------------------
The user is prompted to answer questions on running of the program. It asks for your name. This is used to save your scores do the user_file folder. 

To enter your score, you will have to type the Home team's (Left Team on the image) name then the Away Team's name in the subsequent prompts. This will be followed by asking the user what scores they think each team will score and displays it on the screen. 

User will then back asked if they would like to continue. If yes, program loops again and asks the above questions. If no, this is when the program saves the information to a csv.
